    Onory is a high-level language embedded in Haskell for
    specifying distributed algorithms/systems using common
    notation seen accross papers in the area. The built-in
    interpreter enables a distributed system specified in Onory
    to be compiled to an executable node.
    
    Being able to execute the high-level specification of a
    distributed protocol allows faster iteration and
    observability during the development of existing, or novel,
    protocols. Moreover, the executable derived from the
    specification is automatically able to parse protocol
    configuration options from the command line interface, and
    trace all events being triggered and handled by the running
    protocol.
